# HashFables Token (HASH)

## What is Hash Fables?

HashFables is a Tron based blockchain collective, composed of a few friends from across the world, working to bring new innovations to the Tron ecosystem.

The primary purpose of HashFables is to provide entertainment to our team members and the Tron community as a whole. As such, the scope of our products varies significantly based on what we find is missing from the community, what people are asking for, and personal projects we find interesting.

Here is a table of some of our projects, past, present and future.

Project Name | Type | Centralization | Description | Status | Target Date
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
TRXGen | Tools | Decentralized | A TRX Vanity address generator written in Javascript | Completed | July 2018
TRXRecovery | Tools | Decentralized | A script used to recover private keys containing a single typo. New features will include multiple typos. This has already recovered over 500K TRX that we've been thanked for | Completed | July 2018
BlockLocks | Game | Decentralized | An economic gambling game with a shared jackpot | WIP | April 2019
SmartCrontract | Tools | Centralized | A blockchain automation and alerting platform, including event listeners, triggers, and actions. | WIP | June 2019
TronsDons | Game | Decentralized | A turn based game, where players form teams to compete in organized crime | WIP | Jan 2020

Please note that there are various members working on these projects, all of which have full time jobs, some with families. We do our best to fulfil our promises on timelines, but in the end of the day we are humans and have human things happening. Some of these projects will be broken into multiple phases, including private and public betas, limited functionality, etc. To get more detail on each project and their individual roadmaps, please visit the project's page.




## What is the purpose of the HASH token?

We have recently issued HashFables token on the Tron network, identified by the name HASH. This token was created in order to give team members, beta testers, community members, and other interested parties a way to become involved in the lifecycle of the HashFables umbrella at an early stage, and to give us a way to market some of the work we are doing.

We plan on using the HASH token for all transactions, functions, rewards, and fees for the various HashFables projects. The token is currently an TRC10 token, to allow for easy management and development of a more robust TRC20 (or other) smart contract. In this document, we will give an overview of our plans for token issuance and governance, which may be subject to change. We will be allowing all early token holders the ability to vote in how the token is governed to an extent. Details on voting are yet to come, we need to find a balance between community drive and brand integrity.


**Please note that any migration from TRC10 to TRC20/other will be distributed 100% proportionate to the existing token!**

The exact usage of the HASH token for each project will vary based on the nature of the project and the best way to integrate the token. As such, we cannot guarantee that all HashFables projects will use HASH exclusively, but it is our goal to use it whenever possible, based on technical limitations and maintaining an excellent user experience.

In addition, the value of a HASH token in a HashFables project may or may not be independent of the current market rate depending on the use case. For games with abstracted values, such as BlockLocks, the value of an in-game unit will always be tied to 1 HASH token, regardless of price. For our Smart Crontract automation platform, you will be able to pay fees with HASH. These fees will be based on market rate, network congestion, and third party service pricing.

We plan on submitting an application to have the HASH token listed on multiple exchanges, once we believe our projects are in a position to offer value to the Tron Network and Community. The timing of this is at the discretion of the HashFables team in order to preserve brand integrity, though we always value the input of the community and token holders.




## Initial Token Offering

- Our HASH token is going live on November 18th, 2018 for direct purchase via the Tron network.
- The price is currently pinned at 10 TRX per 1 HASH during the offering event.
- The offer is open from November 18th, 2018 to January 19th 2019, approximately 60 days.
- The offer is limited to 1,000,000 tokens. The other 9,000,000 tokens are frozen until after the event ends.


## Post Offer Distribution

Once the initial token purchase phase is complete on January 19, the next phase will be initiated and additional tokens will be issued in accordance with our governing policy. The exact details of the policy are still being defined, but they will follow the spirit of the project which can be defined roughly as follows:

- A total of 10,000,000 tokens have been created, in which 5,000,000 are to be frozen for a period defined by existing token holders for future reserves.
- Of the remaining 5,000,000 tokens available, the distribution will follow the below table as close as possible.

Phase | Governance | Value
--- | --- | ---
Initial Token Offering | Confirmed | 1,000,000 Max
Development Team | Confirmed | 500,000 Max
Promotional/New User Air Drop | Vote | 1,000,000 Max
Partnerships and Payments | Vote | 1,000,000 Max
Frozen for Future Devs | Vote | 500,000 Max
Unallocated / Frozen | Vote | 1,000,000
Max Circulating Supply |  | 5,000,000
Minimum Frozen Supply |  | 5,000,000

**Team Commitments:**
The HashFables team is committed to the long term outlook of the Tron network and the HashFables community. We are intending to keep as many tokens frozen as needed, and preserving the tokens for future use as best as possible. As such, we will NOT mint new tokens unless voted upon and distributed to existing holders proportionately. We will NOT unfreeze tokens without voting by existing token holders and the community. We will NOT sell tokens marked for freeze, promotion, development, or partnerships beyond the minimum necessary required for development purposes.

Our team holds each other to the highest standards and plans to distribute development tokens on a fair and transparent basis, eventually controlled by a smart contract with the possibility of allowing the community to reward and penalize the team based on their work and behavior, such as rewarding exceptional community support and project delivery, or penalizing for negative impact such as hostilities or dumping of personal tokens without prior community approval. We are committed to 100% transparency in both the projects actions and individual contributors actions to the extent that they impact the project.


## Investment Strategy

HashFables is an Open Source, community driven team, platform, and set of tools. We created this token as a means to spur community involvement, marketing, and having a single constant store for projects across the platform. **HASH is NOT an investment vehicle! Please do NOT purchase this token as a speculative investment!** We strive to keep this project alive and thriving and have community governance, but people do make mistakes, have delays, or have other unforeseen issues. Please do not buy these tokens unless you understand what we are trying to do here and want to support our team. This is not Bitcoin at $0.001, this is a utility token that may never be worth anything in the future! Seriously, don't mortgage your house to buy these things!
